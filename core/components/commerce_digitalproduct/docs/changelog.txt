Digitalproduct for Commerce

This extension is now an official extension for Commerce, maintained by modmore and covered by support. Thank you Tony Klapatch for your hard work on this module before!

New features:
- Add digitalproduct.get_user_files snippet to list users' previously purchased digital products. Uses the same data structure as the thank you page and order messages, plus the order the product was purchased in.
- Digital product download links are now available in order messages as well, same format as for the thank you page

Improvements:
- Bump minimum requirements to Commerce 1.2.0-rc3+, MODX 2.7+ and PHP 7.1+
- Simplify product form a bit, more logical layout for editing the digital options

Fixes:
- Fix digital product information (resource/download links) not being available on the thank you page
- Switch default engine from MyISAM to InnoDB
- The "Digitalproduct Product" class is now hidden, with the shipment approach it's no longer needed to use the separate product type
- Fix incorrect composite relation from Digitalproduct > DigitalproductFile
